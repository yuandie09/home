		<h1> Description </h1>
		<p> Arcane is a show based on the universe of the popular game &ldquo;League of Legends.&rdquo; featuring many champions from the game including the main characters of the story, two sisters named Vi and Jinx. They face difficulties and forces that tear them apart, eventually finding themselves on opposing sides of a developing fight over clashing convictions and arcane technologies. Nonetheless, they persist. All in the hopes of reuniting once again. However, when they reconcile, it appears that they are not the same people they once knew.
